as we are using tabs the tabs provide two probs for indicator

1) value => which is the indicator positon if we write value={0} it will show the idicator to o index if 1 then it will go 1 index check it on your code 
now will change the indicator progrmatically for that we will use hooks 

2) onchange=> is the 2nd prob provided by the tabs to change the positon of indicator through hooks


   use of UseState to change the indicator position 
   
             a) import it outside export default 
             import React ,{ useState}  from 'react';
             
             b)now inside export default use usestate
               const[IndicatorCurrent , IndicatorNewPosition] = useState(0);
               
               c) now create the functon which will monitor the e(event)  where the mouse is clicked it will go there and 2nd will be its index that it will take as parameter
               
   const Indicator= ( e , IndicatorCurrentValue) =>{ //console.log(IndicatorCurrentValue);    IndicatorNewPosition(IndicatorCurrentValue);
   
   
   now change the value into IndicatorCurrent and on change it will go indicator functon 
   
   <Tabs  value={IndicatorCurrentValue}  onChange={Indicator} className={classes.Tabs} variant="scrollable">
   
   now to change indicator color use probs  indicatorColor which is primary and secouondary

   now when we click on indicator it goes where it is clicked but url or route is not changing above now we will change the url
